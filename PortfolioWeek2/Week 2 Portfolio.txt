This week I worked on trying to learn HTTP requests and parallel processing.   I found a tutorial to follow and I was able to get a XML feed onto a simple sample app on my emulator.  There wasn't much time to learn code this week because we didn't have our first meeting until pretty late into the week.  I do feel like I learn quite a bit with the little time I did have.

You can find my code I have created in the http&parallelprocessing folder in this repo.
